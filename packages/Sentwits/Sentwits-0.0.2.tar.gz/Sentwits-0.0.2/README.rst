    XiaYao: $TSLA not a horrible day üòé Bullish

    bendrobidow: $TSLA btw, Bernie and Karen Warren simply use Elon&#39;s name as click bait. Same strategy as in every news outlet.
    Nobody cares about Bernie and Karen, nobody want&#39;s to hear anything they r saying, but as soon as they mention Musk, everyone is talking about them again

    Not sure if Elon&#39;s strategy is helpful. He answers and helps their major goal, they just want to stay relevant 

    TradeNetWork: $BTC.X $TSLA very green added in 940s 

    Epic_Economics: $TSLA Elon!!! Tweet something for the crypto kiddos. Quick 

    BangHussleTheGreat: $LCID my only concern is quality. I‚Äôm hoping LUCID doesn‚Äôt have these issues. From what I understand a lot of the employees are already owners of other EV‚Äôs so they should try their best to prevent the types of issues seen here. This is not a shot at Tesla by posting this, I believe in trial and error. If it wouldn‚Äôt have been for $TSLA ‚Äôs trials we‚Äôd be in for major errors. https://fb.watch/9UNStCKnKg/ Bullish

    BannedGecko: $TSLA If you&#39;re up 10x on Tesla.  It&#39;s time to start winding down positions.  $TM $GM and every single car manufacturer on the planet has just released their new EV concepts.  And the analyst reception is unbelievable.

    Anything is possible where money is manipulated.  But it is quite interesting to see the back channel forecasts for Tesla at sub 500.

    I wonder what&#39;s cooking. Bearish

    Vinnyhuynh: $TSLA if you don‚Äôt  Buy now, don‚Äôt buy later at $1,000 Bullish

    ineverleft1: $TSLA HIGHEST MARGINS THE NEXT DECADE! Bullish

    Mysticx213: $TSLA back over 1k EOW Bullish

    FlipperFastDaBull: $TSLA This is how to recoup some bear attacks.... $AAPL Bulls...some big money moves are on the way tomorrow!  Covid news had to cross the tape so there isn&#39;t a tapper tantrum, but a SURGE tantrum tomorrow!  Stocks, 700 Point day tomorrow GAINER, you heard it here first.  Chinese stocks are still declining, and Mega&#39;s will get their Santa Rally if you played your cards right.  $AAPL 175-190 calls will print tomorrow, loaded the dip with TSLA.  New highs before year end! Bullish

    HotStuff: $GRAB had a nice comeback from below $6 to $6.75. Not the best stock since its IPO earlier this month. Will definitely keep an eye on this one.
    $TSLA rebounded from a $930 low to over $960 before the close. Was able to get quite a few in the mid $930&#39;s.
    $PTPI received a major haircut as shares were trading at $4.38 yesterday and declined to $2.56 today. Stock has very nice volatility for good trading opportunities. Not for the faint of heart but a lot of fun.
    $ADGI did wash out at $6.30 with a 81% selloff today recovering to $7.26 at the close, up 15% from today&#39;s washout low. Evaluating a possible rebound potential to maybe $10-$11 which could be doable. Bullish
