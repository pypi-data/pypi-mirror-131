        ## Motivation
        
        I forget how to do plenty of Python things regularly that I have solved before and find myself wasting time looking through old code to figure out how I did something in the past. I am storing some helper methods in this package, so I can use them during rapid development of stuff.
        
        
        ## Process
        
        * Use this package when developing rapidly
        * When I have my tools in a more usable state, I can eliminate the tool's dependency on `kinnaird-utils` by simply copying over the helper methods to the tool I am working on.
