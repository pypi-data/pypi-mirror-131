================
Command line use
================
ODMax is first and foremost intended to be a command line utility. You simply call it with


.. code-block:: console

    $ odmax

and with a set of command line arguments. Below the possible arguments are described in full.

.. program-output:: odmax --help

The command line options can also be shown by:

.. code-block:: console

    $ odmax --help

Below we show an example command, assuming you have a video file called ``a_walk_in_the_park.mp4`` in the folder ``/home/random_user/videos``, that you wish to
extract still frames every 25 frames, starting at 10 seconds into the video, and ending at 2 minutes (i.e. 120 seconds).
We also assume that you wish to reproject the stills into 6-face cubes using bilinear interpolation. You will write
the results in a subfolder called ``stills`` and use a prefix ``walk``.

.. code-block:: console

    $ odmax -r -m bilinear -s 0 -e 1 -d 5 -p "walk" -i "/home/random_user/videos/a_walk_in_the_park.mp4" -o "stills/home/random_user/videos/"

.. note::
    Please make sure that path names and prefixes are always placed between quote signs such as
    ``"/home/some user/some file"``. If you do not apply quote signs and the path contains spaces, the path will not be
    parsed correctly.

When ODMax is installed with ``exiftool`` the CLI will notify that an ``exiftool`` installation was found and will
stamp each produced still image with time and geographical information. If not, the user will be notified of this
and the still will be processed without time and geographical information.
