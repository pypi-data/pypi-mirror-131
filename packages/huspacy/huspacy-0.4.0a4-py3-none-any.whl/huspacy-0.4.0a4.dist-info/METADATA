# HuSpaCy: Industrial-strength Hungarian NLP

HuSpaCy is a [spaCy](https://spacy.io) model and library providing industrial-strength Hungarian language processing facilities. A live demo is available [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/huspacy/demo). 

This repository contain material to build the models for HuSpaCy.

## Installation

To get started using the latest Hungarian model, you can fetch the model by installing `huspacy` from PyPI:

```bash
pip install huspacy
```

This should be followed by the model download:

```python
import huspacy

huspacy.download()
```

Alternatively, one can install the latest models directly from Hugging Face Hub:

```bash
pip install https://huggingface.co/huspacy/hu_core_news_lg/resolve/main/hu_core_news_lg-any-py3-none-any.whl
```


To speed up inference, you might want to run the models on GPU for which you need to add CUDA support for spacy as described in [here](https://spacy.io/usage).

## Usage

```python
# Load the model through huspacy
import huspacy
nlp = huspacy.load()

# Load the mode using spacy.load().
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load("hu_core_news_lg")

# Or load the model directly as a module.
import hu_core_news_lg
nlp = hu_core_news_lg.load()

# Either way you get the same model and can start processing your texts.
doc = nlp('Csiribiri csiribiri zabszalma - négy csillag közt alszom ma.')
```

For a detailed guide on usage, check [spaCy's documentation](https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features).

## Available Models 

Currently, we only support a single large model which has a good balance between accuracy and speed. You can play around with the tool capabilities in this [interactive demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/huspacy/demo).

[`hu_core_news_lg`](https://huggingface.co/huspacy/hu_core_news_lg) provides tokenization, sentence splitting, part-of-speech tagging (UD labels w/ detailed morphosyntactic features), lemmatization, dependency parsing and named entity recognition and ships with pretrained word vectors.

Models' changes are recorded in the [changelog](https://github.com/spacy-hu/spacy-hungarian-models/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Development
 
### Installing requirements

- `poetry install` will install all the dependencies
- For better performance you might need to [reinstall spacy with GPU support](https://spacy.io/usage), e.g. `poetry add spacy[cuda92]` will add support for CUDA 9.2
