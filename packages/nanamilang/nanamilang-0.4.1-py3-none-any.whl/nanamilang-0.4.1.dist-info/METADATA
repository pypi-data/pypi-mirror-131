# NanamiLang - Chiaki Nanami Language

<img src="https://nanamilang.jedi2light.moe/res/pic/NanamiLang-Logo-v0.1.svg" alt="Logo" width="250"/>

[NanamiLang](https://nanamilang.jedi2light.moe) is an experimental LISP language dialect with immutable data structures.

## Documentation

Read the NanamiLang documentation at the [ReadDocs](https://nanamilang.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Key points

1. The project main goal is to create a LISP language dialect with immutable data structures.
2. The project name was inspired by the character Chiaki Nanami from the game named Danganronpa v2.

## Data Types

### Simple Types

| Type Name       | Purpose                                                             |

| *FloatNumber*   | Encapsulate Python 3 float                                          |
| *IntegerNumber* | Encapsulate Python 3 int                                            |
| *Keyword*       | Encapsulate Python 3 str                                            |
| *NException*    | Encapsulate Python 3 Exception class                                |
| *Undefined*     | To mark as an undefined at parse-time                               |
| *Macro*         | Encapsulate macro name and its Python 3 handle                      |
| *Function*      | Encapsulate function name and its Python 3 handle                   |

### Complex Types

| Type Name       | Purpose                                                             |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *Set*           | Implements a Set of NanamiLang Base data types                      |
| *Vector*        | Implements a Vector of NanamiLang Base data types                   |

## Collaborators

1. @jedi2light - (aka. Stoian Minaiev) - Creator & Maintainer of the project.
2. @buzzer13 - the project contains `AST._create()` method that was initially written by that person.

## Installation methods and proposed ways to use

0. Ensure that you have `GNU Make` installed on your system, then go to the project root and run `make install`.
    1. Alternatively, you can install `nanamilang` from PyPi repository, just run `pip3 install nanamilang` command.
1. Check whether your `~/.local/bin` and `~/.local/lib` directories are present in your `$PATH` environment variable.
2. `nanamilang-repl.py` allows you to type expressions, and evaluate them on-the-fly.
3. `nanamilang-eval.py` reads a file (if it exists), evaluates it, and returns a corresponding value to a host system.

## NanamiLang eval script options explained

Instead of writing large `help` messages for every option, here you can find an explanation for all of them:  
1. `<program>`  
   First argument, must be a path to the source code of your Nanamilang program. You can omit that.
2. `--lisence`  
   It just tells the script to show NanamiLang core license. Output would be `License is GNU GPL v2`
3. `--version`  
   It just tells the script to show Nanamilang core version. Output would be `NanamiLang <MAJ>.<MIN>.<P>`
4  `--include-traceback`  
   It tells REPL script to show you a traceback of occurred exception.  
   Technically, its just tells `nanamilang.datatypes/NException.format(include_traceback=True)` to include tb.

## NanamiLang frmt script options explained

Instead of writing large `help` messages for every option, here you can find an explanation for all of them:  
1. `<program>`  
   First argument, must be a path to the source code of your Nanamilang program. You can omit that.
2. `--lisence`  
   It just tells the script to show NanamiLang core license. Output would be `License is GNU GPL v2`
3. `--version`  
   It just tells the script to show Nanamilang core version. Output would be `NanamiLang <MAJ>.<MIN>.<P>`

## NanamiLang REPL script options explained

Instead of writing large `help` messages for every option, here you can find an explanation for all of them:  
1. `--no-greeting`  
   It tells REPL script to not show you certain information like:  
   `readline` history path, 'how to get doc' and 'how to exit from REPL' tips.
2. `--include-traceback`  
   It tells REPL script to show you a traceback of occurred exception.  
   Technically, its just tells `nanamilang.datatypes/NException.format(include_traceback=True)` to include tb.
3. `--show-measurements`  
   You can measure evaluation time using `(measure ...)` macro (see also `(doc measure)` to get more).  
   But `--show-measurements` tells the REPL to display `nanamilang.program.Program.mesaurements()` for each stage
   of `nanamilang.program.Program` evaluation, including: `Tokenizer.tokenize()`, `AST._create()`, `AST.evaluate()`.

## NanamiLang Core API Usage Example in Python 3

```python3
from nanamilang import program

source = '(+ 2 2 (* 2 2))'
program: program.Program = program.Program(str(source))
program.format()  # => "(+ 2 2 (* 2 2))"
program.ast()  # => get encapsulated AST instance
program.tokenized()  # => collection of a Token instances

results = program.evaluate() # => ((<IntegerNumber>: 8, ...),)
```
