The Greykite model
------------------
Greykite is a forecast library that allows you to do exploratory data analysis (EDA),
forecast pipeline, model tuning, benchmarking, etc. It includes the Silverkite model, a forecast model
developed by Linkedin, which allows feature engineering, automatic changepoint detection,
holiday effects, various machine learning fitting methods, statitical prediction bands, etc.
The Silverkite model has many pre-tuned templates (i.e. parameter configs) to fit for different
forecast frequencies, horizons, and data patterns.
Besides Silverkite, it also includes an interface for the Prophet model developed by Facebook.

This document is for users of the Greykite python library.
