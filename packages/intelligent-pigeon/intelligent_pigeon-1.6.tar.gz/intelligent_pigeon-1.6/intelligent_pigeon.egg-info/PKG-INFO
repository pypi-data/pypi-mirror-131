Description: 
        Intelligent Pigeon is a program made form IOT, by which you can detect Object from a Image and send to a server.
        
        ## Command for extracting images from a video:
        
        ```
        python pigeon.py extract video_path output_path
        ```
        After running the code output_path will created with 4 subfolder on your current folder, and image extracted on those folders.
        
        ## Command for detect object and send it to server is: 
        
        ```
        python pigeon.py send <server_name> <path> weights classes.txt labeled
        ```
        
        `server_name` is where you want to send object detected image.
        
        `path` is the path from where you want detect and send images.
        
        `weights` is darknet trained file for yolov4 object detection which you have to download.
        
        `classes.txt` is a text file where list of all object present.
        
        `labeled` is optional. If you want to send The image to the server with label then write it.
