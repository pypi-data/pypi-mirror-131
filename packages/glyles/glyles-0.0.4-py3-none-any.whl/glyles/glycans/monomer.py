class Monomer:
    """
    General interface to represent the sugar monomers in the tree.

    The resulting molecule must have some properties that are especially important for the correct implementation of
        the parser later on:
          - The C atoms have IDs 1 to 6 according to their C1-C6 naming in a glycan.
          - The O atom closing the ring has id 10, so that all other O-atoms have ID 10 higher than the C atom they are
            connected to.
          - The chirality is initial 0 and will only be set in the carbons with respect to the non-OH-group.
          - Additionally, all members of the ring of the molecule have an according flag set to true.

    Depending on the concrete implementation the actual ids of the atoms might vary, but the rest of the program will
    use the atom ids as specified here. So, an alternative naming must internally be converted to this specification.
