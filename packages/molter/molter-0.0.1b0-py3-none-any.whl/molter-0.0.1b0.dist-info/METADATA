# Molter - WIP
Shedding a new skin on [Dis-Snek's](https://github.com/Discord-Snake-Pit/Dis-Snek) commands.

Currently, its goals are to make message commands more similar to [discord.py's](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) message commands.

# Installing
```sh
pip install molter
```

# Example
Load this as a normal scale in `dis_snek`
```python
import dis_snek
import molter
from typing import Optional


class CommandTest(dis_snek.Scale):

    @molter.msg_command()
    async def test(
        self,
        ctx: dis_snek.MessageContext,
        a_num: int,
        a_user: Optional[dis_snek.Member],
        a_bool: bool,
    ):
        await ctx.message.reply(f"{a_num} {a_user} {a_bool}")


def setup(bot):
    CommandTest(bot)
```

## Note

* This project is a work in progress - it is very unstable and potentially very broken. Basic testing has been done, but more is still required.
* As of right now, variable arguments only pass everything as strings, though they still function.
* `Typing.Literal` and discord.py's `Greedy` have not been added yet. Similar features to them are planned to be added in the future.
