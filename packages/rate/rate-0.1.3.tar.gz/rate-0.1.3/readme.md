- [Glicko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glicko_rating_system)
- [Glicko-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glicko-2_rating_system)
- [TrueSkill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueSkill)
- [DWZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWZ_rating_system)
- [ECF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECF_grading_system)

## Usage
```
rate
```
And you will get prompted with interactive options to select:
- File
- First player key in the file
- Second player key in the file
- Result key from the first player perspective in the file
- Algorithm to use `[all, elo, "glicko-1", "glicko-2", "trueskill", "dwz", "ecf"]`
- Output Format `[csv, json]`
- How a win is defined in the file `Example`: `1` or `win` 
- How a loss is defined in the file `Example`: `0` or `loss` 
- How a draw is defined in the file `Example`: `0.5` or `draw`
