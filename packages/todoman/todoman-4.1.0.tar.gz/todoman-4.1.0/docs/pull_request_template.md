<!--

Items to keep in mind:

- When opening a PR tests will run, you'll be notified if any tests fail.
- The same applies to documentation; if there's any breakage, CI will check
  this for your.
- Make sure you're using `pre-commit` locally to run any fixes/checks.

See the relevant documentation for more details:
