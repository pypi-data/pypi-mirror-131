Description: # PyML
        A python HTML builder library.
        
        
        # Goals
        - [x] Fully functional html builder similar to the javascript node manipulation.
        - [x] Implement an html parser that returns a Document instance with the proper properties and children.
        - [ ] Prettify JavaScript to fit in with the prettified html.
        - [ ] Add more API methods.
        - [ ] Add CSS selector support.
        - [ ] Add styling configuration.
        
        # Usage
        If you have ever manipulated html using JavaScript then this should be really intuitive.
        You just use the document to create a node.
        You then modify the node with the properties and children that you want.
        And insert that node into the document.
        
        ```python
        from PyML import Document
        
        doc = Document()
        doc.title = "Example title!"
        
        print(doc)
        ```
        results in
        ```html
        <html>
            <head>
                <title>Example title!</title>
            </head>
            <body></body>
        </html>
        ```
        
        # Parsing html as a Document
        Note: The parser is very experimental, that means that it might not be able to properly parse some html.
        ```python
        from PyML.parser import doc_from_string
        
        html = """
        <html>
            <head>
                <title>Example title!</title>
            </head>
            <body>
                <div class="heh">
                    <img src="myImage.png">
                </div>
            </body>
        </html>
        """
        
        doc = doc_from_string(html)
        print(doc.title)
        print(doc.find("img").properties["src"])
        ```
        
        
        # Contributing
        Anybody is free to contribute if they want, just make sure you follow the points listed below:
        - Don't rename/move methods/objects without consulting me first.
        - Don't introduce new functionality without explaining in-depth why we need said functionality (unless its from the [Goals](#goals) section)
        - Your code must be PEP-8 compliable.
