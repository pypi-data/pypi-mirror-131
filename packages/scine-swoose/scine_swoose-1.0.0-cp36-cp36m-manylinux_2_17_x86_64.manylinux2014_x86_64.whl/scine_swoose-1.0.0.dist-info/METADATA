Introduction
------------

This repository contains the Swoose module of
the SCINE open-source quantum chemistry software.
It provides functionalities for treating large molecular
systems with self-parametrizing system-focused atomistic models.
This includes the automated parametrization of such models and
applying them in single point calculations as well as structure
optimizations or molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, this
module also provides QM/MM hybrid models.
