OpenDP-PyTorch is an extension to the [OpenDP](https://github.com/opendp/opendp) library for 
differentially private training of pytorch neural networks.

OpenDP-PyTorch is part of the larger [OpenDP Project](https://opendp.org), a community effort to build trustworthy,
open source software tools for analysis of private data.

## Status

OpenDP-PyTorch is under development, and we expect to [release new versions](https://github.com/opendp/opendp/releases) frequently,
incorporating feedback and code contributions from the OpenDP Community.
This library is not ready to build privacy-sensitive applications.

> OpenDP, like all real-world software, has both known and unknown issues.
> If you intend to use OpenDP for a privacy-critical application, you should evaluate the impact of these issues on your use case.
>
> More details can be found in the [Limitations section of the User Guide](https://docs.opendp.org/en/stable/user/limitations.html).


## Installation

The easiest way to install OpenDP-PyTorch is using `pip` (the [package installer for Python](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)):

    $ pip install opendp-pytorch

More information can be found in the [Getting Started section of the User Guide](https://docs.opendp.org/en/stable/user/getting-started.html).

## Documentation

Documentation is not yet available for the PyTorch extension.
