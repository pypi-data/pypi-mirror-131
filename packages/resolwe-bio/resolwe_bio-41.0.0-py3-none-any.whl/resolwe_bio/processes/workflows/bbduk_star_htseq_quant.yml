  description: |
    This RNA-seq pipeline is comprised of three steps, preprocessing,
    alignment, and quantification.

    First, reads are preprocessed by __BBDuk__ which removes adapters, trims
    reads for quality from the 3'-end, and discards reads that are too short
    after trimming. Compared to similar tools, BBDuk is regarded for its
    computational efficiency.  Next, preprocessed reads are aligned by __STAR__
    aligner. At the time of implementation, STAR is considered a
    state-of-the-art tool that consistently produces accurate results from
    diverse sets of reads, and performs well even with default settings. For
    more information see [this comparison of RNA-seq
    aligners](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4106). Finally, aligned
    reads are summarized to genes by __HTSeq-count__. Compared to
    featureCounts, HTSeq-count is not as computationally efficient. All three
    tools in this workflow support parallelization to accelerate the analysis.
