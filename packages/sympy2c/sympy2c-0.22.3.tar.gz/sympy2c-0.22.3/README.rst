``sympy2c``:

- takes symbolic expressions from sympy and creates a Python C extension offering
  functions to evaluate these.

- offers an ode solver in C which accepts equations specified as ``sympy`` expressions.

- offers ``sympy`` extenstion to specify integrals for numerical approximation in ``C++``.

- offers ``sympy`` extenstion to specify 1D interpolation functions which can be evaluated
  in ``C++``.

- offers fast ODE solvers in ``C++``.
