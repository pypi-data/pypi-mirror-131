﻿Geographic and meteorological data analysis（gma）

gma is a geographic and meteorological data processing and analysis library. It mainly contains 5 parts, namely:

1.index [index calculation]
Including EVI, NDBI, NDVI, NDWI and Penman-Monteith method crop reference evapotranspiration.

2.math [Mathematical operation]
Including missing value interpolation, SavitzkyGolay filtering, moving average filtering, and calculation of RMSE, NRMSE, D, r, R2 and MaxAE.

3. osf [System interaction]
Contains file search, file compression, decompression, and renaming.

4. rasp [raster processing]
Including file merging, band decomposition, cropping, format conversion, mosaic, reprojection, resampling, multidimensional data conversion, raster to vector, array saving as raster, orthorectification, process processing, image fusion, etc.

5.vesp [vector processing]
Including vector file decomposition, file inspection, vector conversion to raster, extraction projection, etc.
