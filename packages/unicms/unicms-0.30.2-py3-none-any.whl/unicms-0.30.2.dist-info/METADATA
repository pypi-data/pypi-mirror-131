4. Fill contents like Categories, Publications, Menus ...
5. **Create a WebPath**, a root node like '/' or a subdirectory

uniCMS is designed for both end users and developers where the developers can create their 
own customzied web applications (CMS) without starting one from scratch and end users 
without any development skills can setup a professional CMS platform without difficulty.

uniCMS was created due to necessity of creation and design of a new protal for the 
University of Calabria. After evaluation of several options, University of Calabria 
having a strong in-house competitive and highly skilled technical team it was decided 
to opt for the development of a brand new CMS solution based on Django framework. 

The entire uniCMS project code is open sourced and therefore licensed under 
the [Apache 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License).
