Sphinx Inplace

Sphinx provides powerful functions, but provides few functions about edit doc inplace.
We have to generate rst files and edit the rst files.
This package provides a new procedure,
that we can write code just in the same directory with python files.

The code was firstly used in pyminer.

This package aims to replace ``sphinx-apidoc`` .

The source docstring is parsed and then generate doc with levels.

In a normal sphinx project,
developers have to maintain *.rst directory.
``Sphinx`` provides series of directors to generate html from python source code.

``sphinx-apidoc`` is required to create ``*.rst`` file structure.
However, if python structure changed, developers have to update ``*.doc`` file structure manually.

This tool do not need ``apidoc`` , and all the doc will automatically generated from python code.

Usage
---------------

Please see the demo directory for more information.

Tips
---------------

``__init__.py`` are important files, the same as in python project.
Directory with ``__init__.py`` will be regarded as the python package,
and the package template will be used.

All the assets can be put in the same directory as ``*.py`` files.
The assets will be copy to the ``docs/rst`` directory.

Thus, relative path is available in ``*.rst`` and ``*.md`` files.

If you are not satisfied with the auto generated ``*.rst`` file,
you can create the ``{filename}.rst`` file at the same directory with the ``{filename}.py``.
The new rst file will cover the autogenerated rst file.
