## Developing

In a separate virtual environment, type

```
(your_venv) $ pip install -e .[all]
```

which will install all the dependencies. Since then, for testing, you can either use `tox` as your test runner or `pytest` directly.

Formatting and linting is done by

```
$ tox -e linters
```

which will run `black`, `flake8`, `isort` and `mypy`. Absence of `mypy` errors is not enforced (for now), but adherence to the formatting standards is required.
