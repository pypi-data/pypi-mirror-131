# Announcing TUF 1.0.0

In the past year we have made an effort to revise, redesign and rewrite this
python-tuf reference implementation, and we are very excited to announce a
stable 1.0.0 release scheduled for January 2022. The release *will* include:
- a modern low-level [*metadata
  API*](https://theupdateframework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/tuf.api.html)
- a fully specification-compliant [*updater
  client*](https://theupdateframework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/tuf.ngclient.html),
  serving as a more robust and yet more flexible stand-in replacement
  for the legacy client updater

As discussed in [ADR 2](docs/adr/0002-pre-1-0-deprecation-strategy.md), this
release *will not* include any legacy code, as its maintenance has become
infeasible for the python-tuf team. The pre-1.0.0 deprecation strategy from ADR
2 applies as follows:

> *Bugs reported with tuf versions prior to 1.0.0 will likely not be addressed
directly by tufâ€™s maintainers. Pull Requests to fix bugs in the last release
prior to 1.0.0 will be considered, and merged (subject to normal review
processes). Note that there may be delays due to the lack of developer resources
for reviewing such pull requests.*

For the reasons outlined in [ADR 10](docs/adr/0010-repository-library-design.md
), this release *will not yet* include a new *repository tool*. However, the new
*metadata API* makes it easy to replicate the desired functionality tailored to
the specific needs of any given repository (see *Migration* for details).




## Migration

Given the clean cut with the legacy reference implementation, we provide the
following migration support:

- detailed code documentation on
  [https://theupdateframework.readthedocs.io](https://theupdateframework.readthedocs.io/)
- verbose [code examples](examples/) for *client updater* usage, and
  repository-side operations based on the low-level *metadata API*
- individual migration support upon
  [request](https://github.com/theupdateframework/python-tuf#contact)
- targeted migration support initiative for known users
