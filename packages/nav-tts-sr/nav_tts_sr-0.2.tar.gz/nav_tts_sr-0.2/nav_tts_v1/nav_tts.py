"""
Nav Module. Version 0.0.1. Unmodified.

The module is made to simplify the things related to voice in python.
The Module class is kind of a wrapper for all the other functions of this module.
Use <from nav import Module> code to get access to all the functions of this module.
You can use <Module.Voice.speak()> for using the text-to-speech (aka tts). The speak() functions takes to parameters, one, the original/main text and the second, gender, use "male" for male voice and "female" for female voice.

You can use <Module.Voice.listen.said_text()> to use speech recognition in python, using the google speech_recognition api. For doing further stuff with the audio, make a variable and call it anything you like, set its value to <Module.Voice.listen.said_text()> and then try printing the variable. The output will be the text that you just spoke.
