# PAODING-DL: A Stochastic Data-free Robustness-preserving Neural Network Pruning Solution

Our python package performs pruning progressively and evaluate robustness automatically. The code is written and tested through Microsoft VS Code.

The execution environment of the experiments on paper is summarised as follows: 
* Tensorflow 2.3.0 (Anaconda, tensorflow-gpu version)
* Python 3.8
* Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

More technical details and documentations will be published soon in the future release.
