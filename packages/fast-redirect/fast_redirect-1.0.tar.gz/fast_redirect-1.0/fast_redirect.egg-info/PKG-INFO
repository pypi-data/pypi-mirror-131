Description: # Fast Redirect
        
        Use Fast Redirect to easily redirect your domains. The idea is simple. You have a JSON database, in which you define domains to redirect, and a few redirect options. Fast Redirect will then redirect traffic as configured.
        
        # Install & Run
        
        We recommend running Fast Redirect in a venv. Install the package with `pip3 install fast_redirect`.
        
        Run `bin/fast-redirect` to start a server on `LISTEN_PORT` (default: `8080`). By default, the server binds only to `::1` (IPv6). Both are configurable.
        
        You may daemonize the server. An example systemd configuration can be found in `fast-redirect.service`.
        
        # Database
        
        The database contains a `redirects` object. In turn, this object contains an object for each redirect with the following properties:
        
        * `destination_url`. The URL to redirect to. Query parameters and the path may be appended (see other options). This **must** be a URL (i.e. `www.domlimev.nl` is invalid).
        * `status_code`. Allowed values `301`, `302` and `303`.
        * `keep_query_parameters`. Whether query parameters are kept. If this is false, query parameters are discarded from the `destination_url`. For example, if this is false, `https://domlimev.nl/page?k=v` will be redirected to `https://example.com`.
        * `keep_path`. Whether the path is kept. If this is false, the path is discarded from the `destination_url`. For example, if this is false, `https://domlimev.nl/this/is/a/path` will be redirected to `https://example.com`.
        
        Example database:
        
        ```
        {
           "redirects": {
              "domlimev.nl": {
                 "destination_url": "https://example.com",
                 "status_code": 301,
                 "keep_query_parameters": true,
                 "keep_path": true
              }
        	}
        }
        ```
        
        # Configuration
        
        A number of configuration variables may be set. You may supply these as environment variables, or in an `.env` file. See the `.env.example` file for more information.
        
        # Dependencies
        
        Fast Redirect only needs [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/) and [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/) to run.
