# Curators

![Coverage](docs/images/coverage.svg) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/curators/badge/?version=latest)](https://curators.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

A package for action selection and optimization.


Action types currently supported are context-naive, contextual, and sequential.

* Context-naive actions, which we'll call simply "naive" assumes the expected
  return is simply a function of the action itself.  This is commonly referred
  to as a multi-armed bandit.
* Contextual actions enable use of observable variables to further improve the
  accuracy of the expected return of actions.  For now, we enabled
  integration of clustering algorithms with a traditional bandit.  Longer
  term, this will grow into more broad support for contextual bandits.
* Sequential algorithms extend the previous optimizations of single actions
  into the optimization of multiple ordered actions.


To facilitate maintaining the mathematical purity of classic models while
maintaining practical interfaces for real world actions, objects are 
categorized into three object types: models, agents, and applications.

* Model - distinct and mathematically pure units of learning.
* Agent - integration of identically shaped models into a single interface.
* Application - tooling around connecting an agent to some real-world medium.


Installation
--------------------------------------------------------

# Pip
`pip install curators`


# Package Build and Install
We use Python's `setuptools` to handle installation.
You can build the wheel and install it elsewhere manually using:

```shell
# from within this repo's root:
python setup.py bdist_wheel

# from within your other project that you're installing this wheel into:
pip install curators-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
```

Or you can install it directly from Github usisng the library name
`git+ssh://git@github.com/BellwethrInc/curators.git` as you would
install any other library through either a `pip install [x]` or including it
directly in your `requirements.txt` file.

Or if you prefer using `https` rather than ssh to connect to github, 
`git+https://github.com/BellwethrInc/curators.git` works as well.


After we get proper releases set up, you'll be able to do 
`git+ssh://git@github.com/BellwethrInc/curators.git@v0.0.0#egg=curators` 
to specify a release as well.

Coming soon: 
* proper versioning


# As a Developer

Within this repo's root, create a virtualenv (or your conda equivalent) and
install the dependencies.

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


Testing
--------------------------------------------------------

Within a developer's environment, run all tests simply with

```shell
    python -m unittest
```

## Coverage

To see testing coverage, run

```shell
    coverage run -m unittest discover  # to generate coverage data
    coverage report  # to render the coverage data to console
    coverage-badge -o docs/images/coverage.svg  # update the coverage badge
```

Docs
--------------------------------------------------------
To build docs

* within your venv
* pip install -r requirements.txt
* `cd docs`
* `make html`

Or if you're within pycharm:
* be sure your current environment also has the docs requirements installed
  * `pip install -r docs/requirements.txt`
* Create and configure a new "Spinx Task" configuration:
    * Be sure `html` is the command selected
    * select `docs/source` as the source directory
    * select `docs/build` directory.
      * Make this directory yourself or let sphinx make it for you.
      * this path is within `.gitignore` so don't worry about stepping on toes within your build dir.
* rerun docs build as needed
* `docs/build/index.html` is the file you want to open in your browswer


Notebooks
--------------------------------------------------------

When running the notebooks, you need to either be working within a virtualenv with 
curators installed or have the root of this repo within your environment's PATH 
or PYTHONPATH.  For example,

    PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:path/to/this/repos/root" jupyter notebook

will leave the rest of your environments unaffected while giving python access to this repo directly.
