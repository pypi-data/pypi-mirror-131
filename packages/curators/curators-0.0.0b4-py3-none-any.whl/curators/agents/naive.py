        """Instantiate a NaiveAgent.

        Creates an instance of a naive agent - an abstraction around arbitrary k-armed bandits where the bandit
        configuration is parameterized.  While the Bandit class lets you both maintain a live model continually
        receiving updates, and/or quickly re-create a new class from scratch from the aggregate historical data, this
        Agent is only built to handle the "query full aggregate history and rebuild" pattern at the moment.  You'll only
        find the ability to set internal state within the class init with only having sampling functions available.

        Parameters
        ----------
        target_var_type : str
            defaults to rate.  See internal bandit class for instruction on customizing sample type.
        n_actions : int
            number of leverls for your bandit
        observations : list[list[int]]
            Aggregate historical performance of all levers represented by the number of positive responses and the
            number of negative responses.  Also accepts a numpy array of the same size and type.
            [(n_pos_l0, n_neg_l0), (n_pos_l1, ...
            This is the same format as the `observations` within the class init.
