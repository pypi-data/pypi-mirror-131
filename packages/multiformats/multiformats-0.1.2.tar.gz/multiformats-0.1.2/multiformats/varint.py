"""
    Implementation of the [unsigned-varint spec](https://github.com/multiformats/unsigned-varint).

    Functionality is provided by the `encode` and `decode` functions, converting between non-negative
    `int` values and the corresponding varint `bytes`:

    ```py
    >>> from multiformats import varint
    >>> varint.encode(128)
    b'\\x80\\x01'
    >>> varint.decode(b'\\x80\\x01')
    128
    ```

        Encodes a non-negative integer as an unsigned varint, returning the encoded bytes.

        - `x < 0` (varints encode unsigned integers)
        - `x >= 2**63` (from specs, varints are limited to 9 bytes)

        Example usage:

        ```py
        >>> from multiformats import varint
        >>> varint.encode(128)
        b'\\x80\\x01'

def decode(varint: Union[BytesLike, BufferedIOBase]) -> int:
    """
        Decodes an unsigned varint from a `bytes` object or a buffered binary stream.
        If a stream is passed, only the bytes encoding the varint are read from it.
        If a `bytes`-like object is passed, the varint encoding must use all bytes.

        Raises `ValueError` if:

        - `varint` contains no bytes (from specs, the number 0 is encoded as 0b0000_0000)
        - the 9th byte of `varint` is a continuation byte (from specs, no number >= 2**63 is allowed)
        - the last byte of `varint` is a continuation byte (invalid format)
        - the decoded integer could be encoded in fewer bytes than were read (from specs, encoding must be minimal)
        - `varint` is a `bytes`-like object and the number of bytes used by the encoding is fewer than its length

        The last point is a designed choice aimed to reduce errors when decoding fixed-length bytestrings (rather than streams).
        If this behaviour is undesirable, consider using `decode_head` instead.

        Example usage with bytes:

        ```py
        >>> from multiformats import varint
        >>> varint.decode(b'\\x80\\x01')
        128
        ```

        Example usage with streams, for the (typical) situation where the varint is only part of the data:

        ```py
        >>> from io import BytesIO
        >>> stream = BytesIO(b"\\x80\\x01\\x12\\xff\\x01")
        >>> varint.decode(stream)
        128
        >>> stream.read() # what's left in the stream
        b'\\x12\\xff\\x01'

        Specialised version of `decode` for partial decoding, returning a pair `(x, n)` of
        the decoded varint `x` and the number `n` of bytes read from the start and/or consumed from the stream.
        Unlike `decode`, doesn't raise `ValueError` if not all bytes were read in the process.

        Example usage with bytes:
