# py-lpsd

 Python implementation of the pylpsd algorithm for computing power spectral density with logarithmically spaced points. 

## Installation

This package can be installed via pip:

```
pip install pylpsd
```

In case you want to edit this, clone this repository and install it in editable mode:

```
