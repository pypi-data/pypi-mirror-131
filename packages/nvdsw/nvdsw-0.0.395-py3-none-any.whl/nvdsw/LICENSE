This license is a legal agreement between you and NVIDIA Corporation ("NVIDIA") 
and governs your use of the NVIDIA Data Science Workbench software application and 
materials provided hereunder (“SOFTWARE”).

This license can be accepted only by an adult of legal age of majority in the 
country in which the SOFTWARE is used. If you are under the legal age of majority, 
you must ask your parent or legal guardian to consent to this license. By taking 
delivery of the SOFTWARE, you affirm that you have reached the legal age of majority, 
you accept the terms of this license, and you take legal and financial responsibility 
for the actions of your permitted users.

You agree to use the SOFTWARE only for purposes that are permitted by (a) this license, 
and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in 
the relevant jurisdictions.

LICENSE. Subject to the terms of this license, NVIDIA grants you a personal, revocable, 
non-exclusive limited license to install and use the SOFTWARE together with NVIDIA GPUs. 
NVIDIA reserves all rights, title and interest in and to the SOFTWARE not expressly granted 
to you under this license.

SOFTWARE FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY. By installing or using the SOFTWARE:

a. You will from time to time have access to content from NVIDIA and from others,

may facilitate how you obtain Content for systems as examples via automatic updates 
or by providing commands and instructions. This license does not describe the Content 
terms of use. Your use of Content will be subject to the applicable terms from the 
Content provider. If you do not agree to the terms that apply to a particular Content, 
you may terminate the use of such Content at your convenience. NVIDIA is not responsible 
for your compliance with terms that apply to Content that is available to you.

b. You may receive access to links to NVIDIA websites or services. NVIDIA encourages 
you to review the terms for use of the applicable NVIDIA websites or services as well

which explains NVIDIA’s policy for collecting and using data.

c. You may receive access to links to third-party websites or services. NVIDIA encourages 
you to review the terms and privacy statements on those sites and services that you choose 
to visit so that you can understand their applicable terms as well as how they may collect, 
use and share personal data. NVIDIA is not responsible for the terms, privacy statements or 
practices of sites and services controlled by other companies or organizations.

reduced or different security, privacy, availability, and reliability standards relative to 
commercial versions of NVIDIA software and materials. You may use a pre-release SOFTWARE 
version at your own risk, understanding that these versions are not intended for use in 
production or business-critical systems.

OWNERSHIP. The SOFTWARE and the related intellectual property rights therein are and will 
remain the sole and exclusive property of NVIDIA or its licensors. The SOFTWARE is copyrighted 
and protected by the laws of the United States and other countries, and international treaty 
provisions. NVIDIA may make changes to the SOFTWARE, at any time without notice, but

is not obligated to support or update the SOFTWARE.

FEEDBACK. You may, but don’t have to, provide to NVIDIA suggestions, feature requests or other 
feedback regarding the SOFTWARE, including possible enhancements or modifications to the SOFTWARE. 
For any feedback that you voluntarily provide, you hereby grant NVIDIA and its affiliates a 
perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, modify, license, 
sublicense (through multiple tiers of sublicensees), and distribute (through multiple tiers of 
distributors) it without the payment of any royalties or fees to you. NVIDIA will use feedback 
at its choice.

NO WARRANTIES. THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF ANY 
KIND INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT ALL ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED. NVIDIA does not warrant 
or assume responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any information, text, graphics, links 
or other items contained within the SOFTWARE.

LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND ITS AFFILIATES SHALL 
NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY LOST PROFITS, 
LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, OR THE COSTS OF PROCURING SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS, 
ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE, WHETHER 
SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED UPON BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, TORT 
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION OR THEORY OF LIABILITY, 
AND EVEN IF THE PARTY HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN ADVISED OF, OR COULD REASONABLY HAVE FORESEEN, THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL NVIDIA’S AND ITS AFFILIATES TOTAL CUMULATIVE 
LIABILITY UNDER OR ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE EXCEED US$10.00. THE NATURE OF THE LIABILITY 
OR THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS OR SUITS SHALL NOT ENLARGE OR EXTEND THIS LIMIT.

TERMINATION. Your rights under this license will terminate automatically without notice from 
NVIDIA if you fail to comply with any term of this license or if you commence or participate 
in any legal proceeding against NVIDIA with respect to the SOFTWARE. Upon any termination of 
this license, you agree to promptly discontinue use of the SOFTWARE and destroy all copies in 
your possession or control. All provisions of this license will survive termination, except 
for the license granted to you.

APPLICABLE LAW; DISPUTE RESOLUTION; INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. This license gives you specific legal 
rights. You may also have other rights which vary from state to state, and jurisdiction to 
jurisdiction. Unless this license is presented to you by NVIDIA in another language, you 
hereby agree to all terms of this license in the English language. If you have any complaint 
about this license or the SOFTWARE, please give NVIDIA a chance to resolve it and contact 
NVIDIA by U.S. Mail at NVIDIA Corporation, ATTN: Legal, 2788 San Tomas Expressway, Santa Clara, 
California, 95051. If NVIDIA is unable to resolve your dispute and you wish to present it to an 
authority for decision, you agree to resolve it according to the laws of the State of Delaware 
without regard to its conflict of laws rules or principles and submit the dispute to binding 
arbitration before an arbitrator from Judicial Mediation and Arbitration Services (“JAMS”) 
located in Santa Clara County, California under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures 
then in effect for JAMS. By entering this license, you agree to bring any claims in your individual 
capacity, and you waive the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action or other 
type of representative proceeding. If for any reason this license to arbitrate is found not to 
apply to a dispute and as a result a dispute proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, any 
dispute shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in Santa Clara County, California. 
Nothing in this license shall prevent a party from seeking injunctive or equitable relief from the 
courts in any jurisdiction to protect data security, intellectual property rights, or other 
proprietary rights.

NO ASSIGNMENT. This license and your rights and obligations thereunder may not be assigned by you 
by any means or operation of law without NVIDIA’s permission. Any attempted assignment not approved 
by NVIDIA in writing shall be void and of no effect.

EXPORT. The SOFTWARE is subject to United States export laws and regulations. You agree that you 
will not ship, transfer or export the SOFTWARE into any country, or use the SOFTWARE in any manner, 
prohibited by the United States Bureau of

Industry and Security or economic sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Department of 
Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), or any applicable export laws, restrictions or 
regulations. These laws include restrictions on destinations, end users and end use. By accepting this 
license, you confirm that you are not a resident or citizen of any country currently embargoed by the 
U.S. and that you are not otherwise prohibited from receiving the SOFTWARE.

ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This license is the final, complete and exclusive agreement between the parties 
relating to the subject matter of this license and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings 
and agreements relating to this subject matter, whether oral or written. If any court of competent 
jurisdiction determines that any provision of this license is illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the 
remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. This license may only be modified in a 
writing signed by an authorized representative of each party.
