Description: # Shulkr
        
        Shulkr is a tool that decompiles multiple versions of Minecraft and commits each
        version to Git
        
        ## Requirements
        
        - Git
        - JDK (>= 17 for Minecraft 1.18)
        - Gradle >= 7.3
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        pip install shulkr
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```sh
        shulkr 1.16 1.17 1.18
        ```
        
        A commit with the decompiled source code will be generated for each specified
        version of Minecraft:
        
        ```
        40240b1 version 1.18
        86dc440 version 1.17
        5d13494 version 1.16
        ```
        
        ## Version Patterns
        
        Ranges of versions can be specified with the `..` and `...` operators:
        - `A..B` expands to all versions between `A` and `B` (inclusive), *not*
          including snapshots
        - `A...B` expands to all versions between `A` and `B` (inclusive), including
          snapshots
        
        `A` and/or `B` can be omitted, defaulting to the earliest and latest supported
        versions, respectively.
        
        ## Options
        
        ### `--repo` / `-p`
        
        By default the source code is generated in the current working directory. To
        specify a different location:
        
        ```sh
        shulkr --repo minecraft-sources MINECRAFT_VERSION
        ```
        
        If the directory does not exist, a new git repo will be created there.
        
        ### `--message` / `-m`
        
        This option lets you customize the commit message format:
        
        ```sh
        shulkr -m "Minecraft {}" 1.18-rc4
        ```
