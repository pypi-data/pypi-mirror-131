Description: # Shulkr
        
        Shulkr is a tool that decompiles multiple versions of Minecraft and commits each
        version to Git
        
        ## Requirements
        
        - Git
        - JDK (>= 17 for Minecraft 1.18)
        - Gradle >= 7.3
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        pip install shulkr
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```sh
        shulkr 1.16 1.17 1.18
        ```
        
        This will generate a commit with the decompiled source code for Minecraft 1.16,
        1.17 and 1.18 in the current working directory:
        
        ```
        40240b1 version 1.18
        86dc440 version 1.17
        5d13494 version 1.16
        ```
        
        Note: It's okay to skip versions. Shulkr generates the source code for each
        version and then commits it to git, so you can include as many or as little
        intermediate versions as you would like.
        
        ## Version Patterns
        
        Ranges of versions can be specified with `..` and `...`:
        - `A..B` expands to all versions between `A` and `B` (inclusive), *not*
          including snapshots
        - `A...B` expands to all versions between `A` and `B` (inclusive), including
          snapshots
        
        `A` and/or `B` can be omitted, defaulting to the earliest and latest supported
        versions, respectively.
        
        Versions can be excluded by adding a *negativie pattern* after it. To negate a
        pattern, add `-`. The following pattern expands to all versions after `A`, up to
        and including `B`:
        - `A...B -A`
        
        ## Options
        
        ### `--repo` / `-p`
        
        By default the source code is generated in the current working directory. To
        specify a different location:
        
        ```sh
        shulkr --repo minecraft-sources MINECRAFT_VERSION
        ```
        
        If the directory does not exist, a new git repo will be created there.
        
        ### `--message` / `-m`
        
        This option lets you customize the commit message format:
        
        ```sh
        shulkr -m "Minecraft {}" 1.18-rc4
        ```
