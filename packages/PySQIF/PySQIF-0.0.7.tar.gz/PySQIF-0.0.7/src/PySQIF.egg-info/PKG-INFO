PySQIF: Python Superconductor Quantum Interference Filters
==============================================

Maintained by [Ali AKGUN](https://github.com/aakgn)

PySQIF stands for Python Super Conductor Quantum Interference Filters. PySQIF is an open-source statistical analysis library for SQUIDs/Bi-SQUIDs. PySQIF library gives the average voltage response of defined Bi-SQUID circuit for each corresponding normalized applied external magnetic flux as an output.
