Description: not_covered_lines
        =================
        
        This module takes a path to a directory, where previously 
        `coverage.py` was executed and thus now has the file `.coverage`
        in it, which it reads. It outputs a list of missing lines in 
        the form `[(filename, line_number)]`
        
        
        ## Usage Example
        
        See `usage_example.py` as an example:
        ```
        $ python3 usage_example.py example.coverage
        ```
        Note: normally it is just `.coverage` but this file is used for testing 
        and as long as it ends with `.coverge` the path is fine
        
        Obviously you want to use this as library, not as script.
