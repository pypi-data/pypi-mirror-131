        # ᵛᶦᵐᵛᶦᵐ'ˢ Connecty
        ## Overview
        1. Install python (Windows or debian)
        2. Install connecty
        3. Setup and run connecty
        ## Install python on Windows
        #### Install Python
        Get the installer [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
        Although you installed python, you will not run python directly, but use the cmd/terminal/powershell
        
        ## Install python on Debian
        Get python 3 through your package manager
        ```
        sudo apt-get install python3
        ```
        ## Install Connecty
        Install connecty
        ```
        python3 -m pip install connecty
        ```
        
        ## Setup
        ### Create a config file
        Save a new text file with your config. You can save it anywhere on your computer.
        The file must be in the .ini format and contain your token and all your connections.
         ```ini
        [BOT]
        token = tokengoeshere
        
        [my_connection_1]
        channels = 123456789 123456789 123456789
        
        [my_connection_2]
        channels = 123456789 123456789 123456789
        ```
        The first section should be called `[BOT]` and contain your token.
        Each subsequent section is a different connection.
        The exact name doesn't matter so name them something memorable.
        
        ### Run the bot
        Run this command in cmd/terminal (installing connecty added the `connecty` command)
         ```
        python3 -m connecty path/to/config.ini
         ```
