# Version constraints for pip-installation.
#
# This file doesn't install any packages. It specifies version constraints
# that will be applied if a package is needed.
#
# When pinning something here, please provide an explanation of why.  Ideally,
# link to other information that will help people in the future to remove the
# pin when possible.  Writing an issue against the offending project and
# linking to it here is good.

# Tox and virtualenv require importlib-metadata<3.0 to support python3.5
# so pinning until both packages drop support for python3.5 &
# update their required importlib-metadata version constraint
importlib-metadata<3.0

# aiohttp latest version 3.7.3 requires chardet<4.0, can be removed once aiohttp==4.0.0 is released.
chardet<4.0

# diff-cover==4.2.0 requires chardet==4.0.0 which is pinned due to aiohttp issue
diff-cover<4.2.0

# requests has a constraint idna<3 in it, so pinning it unless requests updates the constraint
idna<3.0
