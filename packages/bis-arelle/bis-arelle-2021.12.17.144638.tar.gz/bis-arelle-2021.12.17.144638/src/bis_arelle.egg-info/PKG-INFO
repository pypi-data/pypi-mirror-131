[Arelle](http://arelle.org/) is a project to provide an easy to use open source facility for XBRL.

The intent began to meet needs that are not commercially viable, such as to
support under-development extension modules and test suite facilities, in a
compact framework, and to support academic training and projects.

Features
========
* Support for XBRL versioning. 
Validation tool for versioning reports and a production tool to generate the basics of a 
versioning report that can be inferred by diffing two DTSes. 
* Edgar and Global Filer Manual validation 
* Base Specification, Dimensions, Generic linkbase validation 
* Formula validation including support for extension modules
* Instance creation is supported using forms defined by the table linkbase (Eurofiling verison). 
* RSS Watch facility 
* Users can explore the functionality and features from an interactive GUI, command line interface, or web services, and can develop their own controller interfaces as needed.
* The Web Service API allows XBRL integration with applications, such as those in Excel, Java or Oracle.
* QuickBooks is supported by XBRL-GL.

Contribute
==========
Arelle fully integrates test cases with the object models for XBRL instances and 
DTSes. 

This allows continual verification of tool performance as it is extended and 
adapted by its users.
