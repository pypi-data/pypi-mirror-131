Description: # B.AwsCfResponse
        
        A python based library to send response back to
        AWS Cloud Formation service after processing of
        custom resource request.
        
        #### Description
        
        Sometimes a necessity to write custom AWS resource provisioning logic arises. After processing of
        custom resource requests, a resource provider must send the standardized response back to
        AWS CloudFormation service. This package makes a response message from a custom resource provider
        event and sends a callback to AWS CloudFormation service.

        ```
        
        ### Usage & Examples
        
        Create **CfResponse** object using event and context of custom resource provider:
        
        ```python
        from b_aws_cf_response.cfresponse import CfResponse
        
        response = CfResponse(event, context)
        ```
        
        After successful provision of custom resource, initiate SUCCESS response. The response can include data from the custom resource provider. For example, created resource name.
        
        ```python
        # Custom resource provider defined name-value pairs to send with response.
        custom_resource_data = {
          'IndexName': 'opensearch-index-name'
        }
        
        response.respond(
          status=CfResponse.CfResponseStatus.SUCCESS,
          data=custom_resource_data,
          resource_id=custom_resource_id
        )
        ```
        
        Initiate FAILED response if custom resource provisioning failed.
        
        ```python
        response.respond(
          status=CfResponse.CfResponseStatus.FAILED,
          status_reason=error_message
        )
        ```
