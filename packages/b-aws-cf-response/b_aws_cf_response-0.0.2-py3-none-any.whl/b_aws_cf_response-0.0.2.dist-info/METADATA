# B.AwsCfResponse

A python based library to send response back to
AWS Cloud Formation service after processing of
custom resource request.

#### Description

Sometimes a necessity to write custom AWS resource provisioning logic arises. After processing of
custom resource requests, a resource provider must send the standardized response back to
AWS CloudFormation service. This package makes a response message from a custom resource provider
event and sends a callback to AWS CloudFormation service.

#### Remarks

by anyone. Improvements and pull requests are welcome.

#### Related technology

- Python 3
- AWS CloudFormation

#### Assumptions

The project assumes the following:

- You have basic-good knowledge in python programming.
- You have basic-good knowledge in AWS and CloudFormation.

#### Useful sources

#### Install

The project is built and uploaded to PyPi. Install it by using pip.

```

### Usage & Examples

Create **CfResponse** object using event and context of custom resource provider:

```python
from b_aws_cf_response.cfresponse import CfResponse

response = CfResponse(event, context)
```

After successful provision of custom resource, initiate SUCCESS response. The response can include data from the custom resource provider. For example, created resource name.

```python
# Custom resource provider defined name-value pairs to send with response.
custom_resource_data = {
  'IndexName': 'opensearch-index-name'
}

response.respond(
  status=CfResponse.CfResponseStatus.SUCCESS,
  data=custom_resource_data,
  resource_id=custom_resource_id
)
```

Initiate FAILED response if custom resource provisioning failed.

```python
response.respond(
  status=CfResponse.CfResponseStatus.FAILED,
  status_reason=error_message
)
```

#### Testing

The project has tests that can be run. Simply run:

```
