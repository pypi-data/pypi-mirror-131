# gint
A Python class for (large) polynomials over GF(2), based on Python's built-in integers, efficiently implemented in C

The purpose of this package is to support polynomial algebra over GF(2). The
polynomial field is infinite, operations are NOT computed modulo anything.

The package does not depend on numpy nor any other package, instead Pythons built-in variable-sized integers are
used. A Python subclass `gint` is derived from the built-in `int` where the appropriate
operators +, -, \*, /, %, divmod are defined. Exponentiation with standard
integer exponent using ** operator is also allowed. Boolean operators &, |, ^
are supported, even with integers (returning gint). Shift operators with
integer shift are allowed. 

There is a performance penalty due to the Python integer design being based
on 15- or 30-bit chunks. However the generic implementation in C still performs
way better than any pure Python implementation, especially for large polynomials.
