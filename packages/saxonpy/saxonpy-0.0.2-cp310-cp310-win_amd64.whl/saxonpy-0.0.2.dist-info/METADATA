# Saxonpy!

This's a python wheel package of [Saxon](https://www.saxonica.com/saxon-c/documentation/index.html), a XML processor from the Saxonica company. For the first release, we only include the support for the home edition or the open source version. Saxonica already provides an extension for Python but it's easier for regular Python users to install the package with the **pip** command.
