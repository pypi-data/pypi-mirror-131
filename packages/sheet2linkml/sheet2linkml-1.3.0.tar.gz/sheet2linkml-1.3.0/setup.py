    'long_description': '# sheet2linkml\n\n[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/sheet2linkml.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/sheet2linkml)\n\nA python package for converting the CRDC-H data model, which is currently stored in a \n[Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oWS7cao-fgz2MKWtyr8h2dEL9unX__0bJrWKv6mQmM4/). The command line utility built into the package can be used \nto generate a [LinkML](https://github.com/linkml/linkml) representation of the CRDC-H data model.\n\n## Installation Requirements and Pre-requisites\n\n- Python 3.7 or higher\n- [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)\n    - If you do not have a version of Python greater than 3.9, it is recommended to use `pyenv` to be able to easily use and \nswitch between multiple Python versions.\n    - If youâ€™re experiencing issues with pyenv on macOS, you can consider using [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).\n- [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry)\n    - One-time installation commands are available for [osx/linux/bash on windows](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry#osx--linux--bashonwindows-install-instructions) and for [windows powershell](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry#windows-powershell-install-instructions).\n\nIf you are using a Windows machine, typical bash programs will not work on `cmd` in the same way as they work in the Linux/MacOS terminals. To circumvent this, it is recommended that you use one of the following Bash on Windows strategies:\n- [WSL](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/)\n- [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/index.html)\n- [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) \n\nso you can easily execute the command line utilities that are described later in these docs.\n\n\n\n## Installing\n\nCreate and activate a Python 3.9+ virtual environment within which you can install the package:\n\n```shell\npython3 -m venv .venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate\npython -m pip install sheet2linkml\n```\n\n## Authorization\n\nsheet2linkml uses the [`pygsheets` library](https://github.com/nithinmurali/pygsheets) in order to access sheets in\nGoogle Drive. To authorize it to access your Google Sheets, you will need to create and download Google Drive client credentials. First,\n[enable the Google Drive API](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/enable-drive-api). After the API is enabled, \n[create and download the client credentials](https://www.iperiusbackup.net/en/how-to-enable-google-drive-api-and-get-client-credentials/)\nfrom the [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/). Save the file as `google_api_credentials.json` in\nthe root directory of this project. [Detailed instructions and screenshots](https://pygsheets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/authorization.html)\nare also available from the [`pygsheets` documentation](https://pygsheets.readthedocs.io/).\n\n## Command Line Client Usage\n\nIdentify the Google Sheet that you want to convert to LinkML. Note that sheet2linkml is not currently a general-purpose Google Sheet to LinkML converter. It will only work with Google Sheets that have been written in a particular, currently undefined format.\n\nContact your CCDH colleagues to obtain the correct sheet ID and assert it either in a `.env` file or in the shell, like this:\n\n```shell\nexport CDM_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=1oWS7cao-fgz2MKWtyr8h2dEL9unX__0bJrWKv6mQmM4\n```\n\nA `google_api_credentials.json` file is also required in the root of this repo as detailed in the Authorization section above.\n\nAnd the user is responsible for defining \n- `~/path/to/crdch_model.yaml`\n- `~/path/to/logging.ini`\n    - `./logging.ini` may be adaquate for many users\n\n### Then perform the conversion:\n\n```shell\nsheet2linkml --output ~/path/to/crdch_model.yaml --logging-config ~/path/to/logging.ini\n```\n',
