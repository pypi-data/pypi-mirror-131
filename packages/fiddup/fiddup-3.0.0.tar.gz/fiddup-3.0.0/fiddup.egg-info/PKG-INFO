**Fi**le **D**e**Dup**licator

Small tool to quickly scan a directory for files of similar names.
Useful to scan through archives of books, documents, downloads, movies, music, ...

Two modes are available: Assistant (name based comparison), and Hash mode (hash comparison).

Fiddup is non-destructive. It will report similarities and duplicates, but it will not remove them.

In order to keep things performant and memory-limited, hashmode only hashes parts of both files.
In case of false positives, first try to increase the `--chunk_count` flag. (default=5)

### Assistant

Outputs a filename1, filename2, name similarity table. Useful when sorting out things manually on name base.

### Hashmode

Get the hashes from the files and compare the files content-wise by doing so.

## Testing

`python -m unittest discover -s tests`

or

`python -m pytest`
